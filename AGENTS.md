## Architecture

- Feature-based modular structure
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- Redux-Saga for side effects
- Axios isolated in API layer
- Dumb UI components
- Fully implemented async flows with error handling

## Feature-based (FSD-style) + Redux-Saga

✔ Decoupling
✔ Modularity
✔ Redux / Saga
✔ TypeScript
✔ Axios
✔ Enterprise-ready

MUST follow best SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI, GRASP


## REQUIREMENTS
- TypeScript 
- React / Redux architecture 
- Use Axios library for API calls 
- Use redux - saga library for side effects 
- Full completeness of the implementation 
- Decoupling and Modularity for both folder structure and components

##  RESTRICTIONS
